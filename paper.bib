  title = {Orthogonal least squares regression for feature extraction},
  journal = {Neurocomputing},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {216},
  pages = {200 - 207},
  abstract = {In many data mining applications, dimensionality reduction is a primary
	technique to map high-dimensional data to a lower dimensional space.
	In order to preserve more local structure information, we propose
	a novel orthogonal least squares regression model for feature extraction
	in this paper. The main contributions of this paper are shown as
	follows: first, the new least squares regression method is constructed
	under the orthogonal constraint which can preserve more discriminant
	information in the subspace. Second, the optimization problem of
	classical least squares regression can be solved easily. However
	the proposed objective function is an unbalanced orthogonal procrustes
	problem, it is so difficult to obtain the solution that we present
	a novel iterative optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal solution.
	The last one, we also provide a proof of the convergence for our
	iterative algorithm. Additionally, experimental results show that
	we obtain a global optimal solution through our iterative algorithm
	even though the optimization problem is a non-convex problem. Both
	theoretical analysis and empirical studies demonstrate that our method
	can more effectively reduce the data dimensionality than conventional
	methods.},
